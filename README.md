# Bank Account System

## Overview

Welcome to the Bank Account System project! This project provides a simple simulation of a bank account management system, allowing users to perform common banking operations such as depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and checking their account balance. While this is a simplified example, it can serve as a foundation for more complex financial applications.

## Story

Imagine you are a software engineer working for a leading financial institution. Your team has been tasked with creating a modern, user-friendly, and secure bank account management system to meet the evolving needs of customers. The goal is to provide a digital platform where customers can effortlessly manage their accounts from the comfort of their homes.

As part of this mission, you and your team decide to develop a web-based application that empowers users to perform the following actions:

1. **Deposit**: Users can add funds to their accounts by specifying the amount they want to deposit.

2. **Withdraw**: Users can withdraw funds from their accounts, ensuring they have sufficient funds available. The system should prevent overdrawing.

3. **Check Balance**: Users can easily check their account balances at any time to keep track of their financial health.
